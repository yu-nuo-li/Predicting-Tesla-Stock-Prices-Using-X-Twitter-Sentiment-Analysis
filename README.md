# Predicting Tesla Stock Prices Using X (Twitter) Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project examines how public sentiment on social media impacts Teslaâ€™s stock performance, given the significant online presence of its CEO, Elon Musk. We integrate sentiment analysis of Tesla-related tweets with traditional financial indicators to predict both next-day stock movements and future price levels. By combining behavioral data from X (formerly Twitter) with historical market data, we apply multiple machine learning models, including LSTM, SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression, to explore how real-time sentiment contributes to improved accuracy in financial forecasting.
